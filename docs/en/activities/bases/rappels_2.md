# Default variable

you will work with the script `exo_02.py` in the package `exos`. The script already exists with the 
following code:

```python
def add_knight(knight:str, kingdom:list=[]):
    kingdom.append(knight)
    return kingdom
```

Test the function and find what may (maybe) not work.

In such situation, what would you suggest ?

Try working with tests…
